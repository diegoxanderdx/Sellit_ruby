# README Sell IT

This is a project of a course where I made some changes by myself and is deployed in https://sellitdx.fly.dev/ as a project under development.
This project was made with Ruby on Rails MVC pattern, PostgreSQL and Redis as databases and views with Tailwind CSS.
The application is a "virtual yard sale" where administrators can create categories, unregistered users can view products, search, sort and filter products and finally, registered users can perform the actions of unregistered ones, also to create products, add products from other users to favorites.

For the functionality uses
- AciveStorage to store and manage images.
- ActionMailer to send registration mails.
- Hotwire for pagination.
- Stimulus for animated modals.
- Activejob for Background jobs in services connected to an api.
- Turbo for creating websockets to visualize changes in real time of the products (if other user is visulizating).
- Importmaps for the use of some JS libraries to give the frontend some react-like functionalities.
